# knightsTravails

> *The last excercise within TOP's Computer Science module, the purpose was to solve a variation of the common **"Knights Tour"** problem. With the intention to dmeonstrate the shortest path necessitated to traverse from select starting to ending coordinates. This program utilises a **Breadth First Search Algorithm** within the realms of **Graph** data structures*.

## ABOUT

1. Think about the rules of the board and knight, and make sure to follow them.
2. For every square there is a number of possible moves, choose a data structure that will allow you to work with them. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
3. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
4. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like.
